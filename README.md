| dataset: use only the elementary school data. | [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajanand/education-in-india) |

Unfortunately, the dataset was so unsuited for the goals of this project that all files used for rendering the visualizations are manually created by me using multiple python scripts and then a copy-paste spree.

These files are included in the code .zip folder. However, they are also available as gists.

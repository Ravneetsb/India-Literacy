                <p>India is a diverse country, with various religions, languages
                    cuisines, etc.
                    This diversity is also reflected in the literacy rates amongst the Indian States.</p>
            </header>
            <h3>Literacy in Indian States</h3>
            <div id="map"></div>
            <p>Literacy varies by a lot. Kerala has a literacy rate of 93.91, while Bihar only has a literacy rate of
                63.82</p>
            <p>This is a big difference. What could be possible reasons for this?</p>
            <p>At the time this data was collected (2015), India was the second most populated country in the world.
                It would be reasonable to assume that there just aren't enough schools in some states, while other
                states
                have decent infrastructure for the same.</p>
            <p>By dividing the number of schools in a state by the population, we can get what I call <i>School
                Density</i>.
                We can plot the school densities for different states using a scatter plot.</p>
            <h3>School Density is number of schools per 1000 people.</h3>
            <div id="scatterBox">
                <div id="scatter"></div>
                <div id="clicked"></div>
            </div>
            <p>We see that there is no clear correlation between states with higher school density and higher literacy
                rates.
                This is indicative of the fact that <em>It is not enough to just make schools.</em></p>
            <p>Telangana has an unusually high school density. The reason for this is that Telangana was officially
                declared
                as a state only in June 2014. Since the data is for 2015, it stands to reason that people hadn't yet
                transferred
                their domicile certificate to the state of Telangana. A domicile certificate is used to show that one is
                a permanent
                resident of a state.</p>
            <p>Now that we know what school density is, we can use a bubble plot to see a clearer relationship
                between school density and literacy.</p>
            <h3>No Clear Relationship between School Density and Literacy</h3>
            <div id="bubble"></div>
            <p>The packed bubble chart above gives us a clearer way to compare the school densities with literacy
                levels.
                We see that there is no clear clustering on the basis of both size and color. Therefore, we can say that
                it is
                <em>inconclusive</em> as to whether or not school density has an effect on literacy.</p>
            <p> How about Accessibility? It has been a big discussion in India, on how we can improve access to schools
                for all
                people through all season roads. The bubble map below plots the accessibility to schools per state based
                on
                how many schools are connected to all season roads.</p>
            <h3>Higher Accessibility Leads to Higher Literacy!</h3>
            <div id="areaBubble"></div>
            <p>The bubble plot shows us that the states with the highest literacy generally have a higher number of
                schools
                accessible by all weather roads. In fact, most states with a higher literacy rate also seem to have a
                smaller
                population compared to the other states.</p>
            <p>States with a larger population tend to have a lesser literacy rate. Further, Jharkhand seems to be the
                single
                biggest culprit in terms of inaccessibility to schools. While Jharkhand is not the state with the
                highest number
                of inaccessible schools, it is the state with the biggest percentage of inaccessible schools.</p>
            <h3>SC and ST students representation in schools is inconclusive.</h3>
            <div id="bar"></div>
            <p>Most states do not have a equal distribution of students from either Scheduled Castes
                or Scheduled Tribes. The only states that have a similar number of students from
                both categories are Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, both of which have varying literacy rates.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>Methodology</h3>
            <p>The data was taken from kaggle. <br/>
                The data was almost unusable for the purpose of this project. This was because: <br/></p>
            <ul>
                <li>State names in the data were not suited to making a choropleth map.</li>
                <li>GeoJson data for India was hard to find.</li>
                <li>Basically had to run multiple python scripts and then manually copy paste data to appropriate
                    files.
                </li>
            </ul>
